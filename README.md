# theElectorialApp
Mobile Application for Microsoft CodeFunDo++

A mobile application which helps the voters not residing in their registered constituencies to cast their votes from a different location. The application is based on blockchain technology which uses a virtual platform to enable such voters to cast their votes in the Elections without actually travelling to that respective constituency.

The application also faciliates the counting of votes by securely connecting various election centres in a constituency with the use of Azure blockchains for each of the political parties as explained in the diagram.

Additional feature: Also helps to verify the authenticity of the Voter's identity by crosschecking it with a computer generated online voters id and thus preventing non-genuine/ forged voters.
